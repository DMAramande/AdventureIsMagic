## Backstory of the land
The world of Canterlot has seen a lot of strife in its time. For many years it was protected diligently by the six bearers of Harmony: Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie. This was done under the leadership of the three Alicorns, Celestia, Luna and Cadance, that at the time was ruling over equestria. Ever since the alicorns transcended into true gods, the six former heroes of Equestria has had to take their place. The six ponies have taken up residence in Canterlot, serving as the ruling council of Canterlot. They each have a bigger city which they oversee personally as its warden and can often be seen there on routine visits. With the leadership of the country and other royal duties, the six ponies has not been able to keep up with the evil taking root in the shadows.

### Description
The creatures in Equestria aren't usually considered religious, it's more of just a fact of a creature that exists, that you identify with. In fact, for most of the years that Equestria existed, there wasn't even anything that would be considered a god, much less something to be worshipped. But since the transcendance of the Alicorns, there has popped up a couple of places of holy worship, for those that are so inclined.
